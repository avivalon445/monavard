# MySQL 9.4.0 Compatibility Fixes

## Problem
The application was experiencing `Incorrect arguments to mysqld_stmt_execute` errors when running against MySQL 9.4.0 in production.

## Root Causes
1. **MySQL 9.4.0 doesn't exist** - The latest stable MySQL version is 8.0.x. You might be running a different database system or a non-standard MySQL distribution.
2. **Parameter type mismatches** - Prepared statements were failing due to improper parameter type conversion.
3. **Connection configuration issues** - Missing compatibility settings for newer MySQL versions.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated Database Configuration (`src/config/database.js`)
- Added MySQL 9.x compatibility settings
- Enhanced connection pool configuration with proper charset and timezone
- Added support for big numbers and proper type casting
- Disabled SSL for local development, enabled for production

### 2. Enhanced Parameter Conversion
- Created `convertParameters()` utility function to handle:
  - Date objects → MySQL datetime format
  - Boolean values → 1/0 integers
  - Null/undefined values → proper null handling
  - Objects → JSON strings
  - Infinite numbers → null

### 3. Improved Error Handling
- Added fallback mechanism: if prepared statements fail, automatically retry with regular queries
- Enhanced logging for better debugging
- Specific handling for `ER_STMT_EXECUTE_ERROR` and `mysqld_stmt_execute` errors

### 4. Updated MySQL2 Driver
- Upgraded from `mysql2@3.6.5` to `mysql2@3.9.1` for better compatibility

## Testing
The fixes have been tested and verified to work with MariaDB. The enhanced parameter conversion and error handling should resolve the `mysqld_stmt_execute` errors.

### Additional Fix Applied
Fixed a JSON parsing error in the auth service that was causing `"[object Object]" is not valid JSON` errors. The issue was that database queries returning JSON objects were being double-converted, causing parsing failures.

## Environment Variables
Ensure your `.env` file has the correct database settings:
```env
DB_HOST=your-database-host
DB_PORT=3306
DB_USER=your-username
DB_PASSWORD=your-password
DB_NAME=custombid
NODE_ENV=production
```

## Production Deployment
1. Update the MySQL2 package:
   ```bash
   npm install mysql2@^3.9.1
   ```

2. Restart your application to apply the new configuration.

3. Monitor the logs for any remaining MySQL errors.

## Troubleshooting
If you still experience issues:

1. **Verify your MySQL version**:
   ```sql
   SELECT VERSION();
   ```

2. **Check if you're actually running MySQL**:
   ```sql
   SELECT @@version_comment;
   ```

3. **Test with a simple query**:
   ```bash
   node test-db-connection.js
   ```

4. **Check the application logs** for specific error messages.

## Additional Recommendations
1. Consider downgrading to MySQL 8.0.x if possible, as it's the stable, officially supported version.
2. If you're using a cloud database service, check their documentation for any specific configuration requirements.
3. Monitor database performance after applying these fixes.
